## üß© Adding shadcn/ui Components

When adding new UI components, use shadcn CLI with pnpm:

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add [component-name]
```

Examples:
- `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add dialog` - Add dialog component
- `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add input` - Add input component
- `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add form` - Add form component
- `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add label` - Add label component
- `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add avatar` - Add avatar component (already installed)
- `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add badge` - Add badge component (already installed)
- `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add sheet` - Add sheet component for mobile overlays (already installed)
- `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add table` - Add table component for data display (already installed)

This ensures components are properly installed and configured for the project's design system.

**Currently Installed shadcn/ui Components:**
- `button`, `dropdown-menu`, `slot` - Core interactive components
- `dialog`, `input`, `label` - Form and modal components
- `avatar`, `badge` - User interface and status components
- `sheet` - Mobile navigation overlay component
- `table` - Data display component for lab results and medical data
- `select` - Dropdown select component for pagination and filters
- `skeleton` - Loading skeleton component for content placeholders

## üìù TypeScript Standards

- **STRICT PROHIBITION**: The use of `any` type is strictly forbidden
- Always use proper TypeScript typing with interfaces, types, or generic constraints
- Prefer explicit typing over implicit `any` inference

## üìã Form Development Guidelines

**Form State Management:**
- Use React's native `useActionState` hook for form state management and server actions
- Avoid external form libraries (react-hook-form, formik) - prefer React 19 native solutions
- Implement progressive enhancement with server actions as fallback

**Form Validation:**
- Use Zod schemas for all form validation
- Define validation schemas in dedicated files (e.g., `src/shared/lib/validations/`)
- Apply validation both client-side and server-side for security
- Example structure:
  ```typescript
  // src/shared/lib/validations/patient.ts
  import { z } from 'zod'

  export const patientSchema = z.object({
    name: z.string().min(2, 'Name must be at least 2 characters'),
    email: z.string().email('Invalid email address'),
    phone: z.string().regex(/^\+?[\d\s-()]+$/, 'Invalid phone format')
  })

  export type PatientFormData = z.infer<typeof patientSchema>
  ```

**Server Actions:**
- Create server actions for form submissions in `src/app/actions/` or co-located with pages
- Use `useActionState` to connect forms with server actions
- Handle both success and error states appropriately
- Example:
  ```typescript
  // In component
  const [state, action, isPending] = useActionState(submitPatient, null)

  // In server action
  export async function submitPatient(prevState: any, formData: FormData) {
    const result = patientSchema.safeParse(Object.fromEntries(formData))
    if (!result.success) {
      return { errors: result.error.flatten() }
    }
    // Handle valid data...
  }
  ```

- Lab Results Table: Horizontal scrolling on mobile, full table on desktop
- Appointment Cards: Single column on mobile, grid layout on larger screens
- Statistics Cards: Responsive grid from 1 to 3 columns based on screen size

## ü™ù Custom Hooks Usage Guidelines

**API Data Fetching:**
```typescript
import { useUsers, useApi } from '@/shared/hooks';

// For user/patient data
const { data: users, loading, error, refetch } = useUsers();

// For custom API calls
const { data, loading, error, refetch } = useApi(() => apiCall(), {
  immediate: true, // Auto-fetch on mount
  dependencies: [userId] // Re-fetch when dependencies change
});
```

**Pagination Implementation:**
```typescript
import { usePagination } from '@/shared/hooks';

const { state, actions, paginatedData } = usePagination(data, {
  initialPage: 1,
  initialItemsPerPage: 10
});

// Use state.currentPage, state.totalPages, etc.
// Use actions.setCurrentPage, actions.nextPage, etc.
```

**Search Functionality:**
```typescript
import { useSearch } from '@/shared/hooks';

const { state, actions, filteredData } = useSearch(data, {
  searchFields: ['name', 'email', 'phone'],
  caseSensitive: false
});

// Use state.query, state.isSearching
// Use actions.setQuery, actions.clearQuery
```

## üé¨ Animation System Usage

**Basic Animations:**
```typescript
import { FadeIn, SlideIn, ScaleIn } from '@/shared/ui/animations';

// Fade in from bottom with delay
<FadeIn delay={200} direction="up">
  <Component />
</FadeIn>

// Slide in on scroll
<SlideIn direction="left" triggerOnce>
  <Component />
</SlideIn>

// Scale in with bounce
<ScaleIn duration={400}>
  <Component />
</ScaleIn>
```

**Micro-interactions:**
```typescript
import { HoverLift, ClickAnimation, RippleEffect } from '@/shared/ui/animations';

// Hover effects
<HoverLift lift={8}>
  <Card />
</HoverLift>

// Click animations
<ClickAnimation scale={0.95}>
  <Button />
</ClickAnimation>

// Ripple effect on click
<RippleEffect color="rgba(255,255,255,0.6)">
  <InteractiveElement />
</RippleEffect>
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Error Boundary Implementation

**Component-level Protection:**
```typescript
import { ComponentErrorBoundary } from '@/shared/ui/error-boundary';

<ComponentErrorBoundary
  onError={(error) => console.error('Component error:', error)}
>
  <SomeComponent />
</ComponentErrorBoundary>
```

**Page-level Protection:**
```typescript
import { PageErrorBoundary } from '@/shared/ui/error-boundary';

<PageErrorBoundary>
  <PageContent />
</PageErrorBoundary>
```

**Async Error Handling:**
```typescript
import { useErrorHandler } from '@/shared/ui/error-boundary';

const { handleAsyncError, wrapAsyncFunction } = useErrorHandler();

// Wrap async functions
const safeApiCall = wrapAsyncFunction(apiCall, { context: 'user-fetch' });
```

## üî∑ TypeScript Type System

**Using Medical Types:**
```typescript
import type {
  Patient,
  Appointment,
  LabResult,
  ApiResponse,
  PaginatedResponse
} from '@/shared/types';

// Type-safe medical entities
const patient: Patient = {
  id: 'P-2024-001',
  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Doe',
  // ... other required fields
};

// API responses with proper typing
const response: ApiResponse<Patient[]> = await fetchPatients();
```

**Form Type Safety:**
```typescript
import type { PatientFormData, ActionState } from '@/shared/types';

// Server action with typed response
export async function createPatient(
  prevState: ActionState<Patient> | null,
  formData: FormData
): Promise<ActionState<Patient>> {
  // Implementation with proper typing
}
```

## ‚è≥ Loading States and Skeletons

**Using Skeleton Components:**
```typescript
import {
  DashboardSkeleton,
  AppointmentCardSkeleton,
  LabResultsTableSkeleton
} from '@/shared/ui/skeletons';

// While loading dashboard
{isLoading ? <DashboardSkeleton /> : <DashboardContent />}

// Individual component skeletons
{appointments ? (
  appointments.map(apt => <AppointmentCard key={apt.id} {...apt} />)
) : (
  Array.from({length: 3}).map((_, i) => <AppointmentCardSkeleton key={i} />)
)}
```

## ‚ö° Performance Optimization Guidelines

**Lazy Loading and Code Splitting:**
- All animations use intersection observers for performance
- Components are optimized for minimal re-renders
- Custom hooks use proper dependency arrays
- Debounced search to prevent excessive API calls

**Memory Management:**
- Animation cleanup on component unmount
- Event listener cleanup in custom hooks
- Proper dependency arrays in useEffect hooks
- Intersection observer disconnection

**Bundle Optimization:**
- Tree-shakeable imports from shared modules
- Optimized animation library with selective imports
- Lightweight skeleton components
- Minimal external dependencies

## üèÜ Best Practices Implemented

**Component Architecture:**
- Single Responsibility Principle for all components
- Proper prop interfaces with TypeScript
- Consistent error boundary implementation
- Reusable hooks for common functionality

**State Management:**
- Local state for component-specific data
- Custom hooks for shared logic
- Proper state initialization and cleanup
- Optimistic updates where appropriate

**Accessibility:**
- Keyboard navigation in search components
- Proper ARIA labels and roles
- Focus management in modals and dropdowns
- Screen reader friendly animations

**Code Quality:**
- 100% TypeScript coverage with no `any` types
- ESLint rules enforced throughout codebase
- Consistent naming conventions
- Comprehensive error handling

## üîç ESLint Configuration

- Uses Next.js core-web-vitals and TypeScript presets
- Modern flat config format (eslint.config.mjs)

- Enforces no-explicit-any and proper TypeScript usage
- All lint warnings resolved in codebase

## üèóÔ∏è Feature Slice Design Architecture

This project implements Feature Slice Design (FSD) architecture for maintainable and scalable code:

- **Each layer has strict import rules** - higher layers can import from lower layers only
- **Entities** - represent business domain models (Patient, Doctor, Appointment)
- **Features** - contain user interactions and business logic
- **Widgets** - compose features and entities into UI blocks
- **Pages** - compose widgets into full page layouts
- **Shared** - provides reusable utilities across all layers

This architecture ensures clear separation of concerns, easy testing, and team scalability.
